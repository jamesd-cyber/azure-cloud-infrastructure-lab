# Azure Cloud Infrastructure Project

## Overview
This lab demonstrates hands-on deployment and configuration of core Microsoft Azure services, covering Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), storage, database services, and IoT components. All resources were provisioned and validated within the Azure Portal.

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Deployed a Windows Server Virtual Machine (VM)
- Configured a Public IP for remote connectivity
- Created a dedicated Virtual Network (VNet)
- Configured subnet allocation and network association
- Validated VM deployment and connectivity

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Deployed an Azure App Service (Web App)
- Validated the running state within the Azure Portal
- Demonstrated understanding of a managed runtime environment

## Storage & Data Management
- Created a General Purpose v2 Storage Account
- Configured Blob Containers
- Uploaded files to validate object storage functionality and container hierarchy

## Azure SQL Database
- Provisioned an Azure SQL Database and logical SQL server
- Executed SQL queries using Azure Query Editor
- Validated database connectivity and data retrieval

## Azure IoT Hub
- Deployed an Azure IoT Hub instance
- Configured region and pricing tier
- Validated active deployment status

## Skills Demonstrated
- Azure resource provisioning
- Cloud networking fundamentals (VNets, subnets, public IPs)
- Virtual machine deployment and management
- PaaS architecture understanding (App Service)
- Cloud storage management (Blob Storage)
- SQL database deployment and query validation
- IoT service deployment (IoT Hub)

## Validation
Each resource was successfully deployed and validated within the Azure Portal, demonstrating practical familiarity with foundational Azure architecture and cloud engineering concepts.

## Notes
Resources were deployed in a controlled lab environment and decommissioned after validation to manage cloud costs.
